Invitation to All-hands in Tromsø
=================================

Dear all!

We are pleased to invite you to ELIXIR Norway All-hands 2023 and hope that you will join us in Tromsø 18-19 April! 
 
The meeting will take place at `Sommarøy Arctic Hotel <https://sommaroy.no/no/moter-og-konferanser/>`_, approximately one hour outside Tromsø. We will keep the structure from earlier meetings, starting with All-hands on the 18th. 
 
The All-hands meeting will begin after lunch on the 18th and end in the afternoon on the 19th. We will continue with a meeting with our SAC and stakeholder panel 19-20 April, finishing with an afternoon board meeting on the 20th.
 
We will arrange transport between the airport and hotel. Exact times will be announced as soon as we know, but we aim to leave the airport around 12.00 and return from the hotel around 16.00.
 
The program is not ready yet, but will be distributed as soon as possible. Please let me know if you have suggestions for topics we should discuss. Any input is very welcome.

**If you wish to attend the event you need to do two things before Friday 10 February:**

1. Register for the event by completing this form: :doc:`registration`
